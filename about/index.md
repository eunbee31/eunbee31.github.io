<center>I am a Linguist & Research engineer working on Natural Language Processing (NLP). </center>

## Professional introduction
Currently, I am working with industrial data as technical documents (e.g. specification documents, procedural documents) in System Engineering context. In System Engineering, it is crucial to have a good documentation because it allows to reduce the risk of failure in system development. As a linguist & research engineer, I am responsible for developing linguistic rules to detect anomalies in technical documents.

## About me

Since I have lived in several countries with different culture, I have been always interested in different languages and their diversity -- as well as in the diversity of culture. These trips allowed me to be open-minded and to have a good adaptability. I respect the difference that exists among people and I am always curious about everything!

I took advantage when I was in the university to learn other languages that I did not have access to (e.g. Dutch, Spanish). When I was in South Korea, I had Japanese courses and Chinese characters courses at school. Since I had two language baggage since my childhood, I always had the ease to catch the particularity of languages.

Since I was little, I have always been interested in new technology. When I discovered the NLP, I immediately knew it was done for me.
For now, I am only junior in the field. The good thing is that I keep learning and learning. I try to stay on the lookout for new technologies in the NLP.

Also, I am a little nostalgic. I take pictures with an old camera of the 70s. Do not hesitate to go see my photos (by clicking on the camera icon on my site).
