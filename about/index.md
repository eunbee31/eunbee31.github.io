## Simple timeline

## Introduction

Since I have lived in several countries with different culture, I have been always interested in different languages and their diversity -- as well as the diversity of culture. These trips allowed me to be open-minded and to have a good adaptability. I respect the difference that exists among people and I am always curious about everything!

I took advantage when I was in the university to learn other languages that I did not have access to (e.g. Dutch, Spanish). When I was in South Korea, I had Japanese courses and Chinese characters courses at school. Since I had two language baggage since my childhood, I always had the ease to catch the particularity of languages.
