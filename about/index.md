<center>Data scientist in NLP</center>

## Professional introduction
I am working as a NLP data scientist in an Artificial Intelligence startup located in Toulouse. I mainly work on the development of rules in the detection of relationships between named entities in texts.

Having previously acquired experience in symbolic methods, I am now interested in combining this symbolic method with the automatic method. Indeed, I am also working on the improvement of Machine Learning (ML) models in the detection of named entities as well as on the development of ML models in the detection of entity relationships.

## About me

Since I have lived in several countries with different culture, I have been always interested in different languages and their diversity -- as well as in the diversity of culture. These trips allowed me to be open-minded and to have a good adaptability. I respect the difference that exists among people and I am always curious about everything!

I took advantage when I was in the university to learn other languages that I did not have access to (e.g. Dutch, Spanish). When I was in South Korea, I had Japanese courses and Chinese characters courses at school. Since I had two language baggage since my childhood (i.e. Korean and French), I always had the ease to catch the particularity of languages.

Since I was little, I have always been interested in new technology. When I discovered the NLP, I immediately knew it was done for me.
For now, I am only junior in the field. The good thing is that I keep learning and learning. I try to stay on the lookout for new technologies in the NLP.

Also, I am a little nostalgic. I take pictures with an old camera from the 70s. Do not hesitate to go see my photos (by clicking on the camera icon on my site).
